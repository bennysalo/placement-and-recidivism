# Effects of placement in open prison and conditional release on recidivism rates in Finland.

These are ongoing analyses to examine the effect of practices of open prison and conditional release in Finland using propensity score matching.

The project will be more closely described on Open Science Framework. See https://osf.io/zun3y/ for page for this study.

Files are currently being resturctured into a R Package structure. The approach we are following is documented in /old_analyses. Better documentation to come shortly (2018-05-04).
